Finitrip is a dedicated online platform for booking finca accommodations in Mallorca, offering over 300 hand‑picked
properties. It features a multi‑mode search (exact, flexible, name), date and guest filters, and categorical browsing (
families, pets, couples, large groups) to streamline selection. The site includes integrated blogs (“Mallorca Stories”,
seasonal offers), customer testimonials, and direct contact
options, all within a responsive HTML5/CSS3 layout enhanced by JavaScript for interactive search and cookie management.
Under the hood, the absence of typical WordPress paths (e.g. /wp-content/) suggests a custom back‑end—likely
PHP‑based—with a database handling inventory, bookings, and user data. Privacy and SEO are addressed via a
cookie‑consent banner, clean URLs, metadata, and resource minification, while social media links (Instagram, Facebook,
WhatsApp) extend brand engagement.

## Overview

Finitrip specializes in vacation rentals (“fincas”) across Mallorca, emphasizing personalized service without extra
service fees. It provides:

- Catalog of 300+ properties, each manually vetted for amenities like pools and sea views.
- Content sections including “Mallorca Geschichten” (owner and gastronomy stories) and a blog with seasonal promotions.

## Key Features

Advanced Search: Three search modes (exact date, flexible, by name) plus filters for arrival/departure dates and party
size.

- Favorites: Users can bookmark properties for later review.
- Pre‑reservations: Free holds with a 10 % deposit and no hidden fees.
- Testimonials: User reviews with dates and detailed feedback to build trust.
- Contact Methods: German and Spanish phone support, WhatsApp link, web form, and email.

## Technical Architecture

### Front‑end

- **HTML5 & CSS3:** Structured markup with responsive media queries ensures usability across devices.
- **JavaScript:** Powers dynamic search forms, cookie banner controls, and interactive property listings.

### Back‑end

- Custom Framework: Lack of /wp-content/ hints at a bespoke PHP (or similar) solution.
- Database Integration: Likely MySQL or MariaDB for managing fincas, bookings, and user data securely.

## Integrations & Security

- Privacy & Cookies: Banner for cookie consent, linking to privacy policy and terms.
- SEO & Performance: Clean, descriptive URLs; meta tags; minified CSS/JS; and optimized images for fast load times.
- Social Media: Direct links to Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger for cross‑channel engagement.
