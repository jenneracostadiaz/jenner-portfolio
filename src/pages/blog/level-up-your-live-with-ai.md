Lately, I’ve been experimenting with different AI tools in my daily routine—not just as a developer, but as a learner, a curious person, and someone who wants to grow.  
What surprised me is that AI isn’t only useful for programming; it can also help in conversations, studying, research, and even creativity.  
Here I’ll share how I use different tools every day, and how you can integrate them into your own life to grow personally and professionally.
